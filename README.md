3. Select research mode and citation style
4. Click "Start Research" and watch the AI work through multiple phases
5. Review the comprehensive structured results

### CLI Usage

```python
import asyncio
from advanced_autonomous_research_agent import AdvancedAutonomousResearchAgent

# Initialize the agent
agent = AdvancedAutonomousResearchAgent(
    openai_api_key="your-key",
    max_sources=30,
    debug_mode=True
)

# Conduct research
async def research_example():
    result = await agent.conduct_advanced_research(
        query="advancements in transformer architectures",
        citation_style="apa"
    )
    
    print(f"Executive Summary: {result.executive_summary}")
    print(f"Sources Found: {len(result.sources)}")
    print(f"Quality Level: {result.quality_assessment['quality_level']}")

asyncio.run(research_example())
```

### Legacy CLI Mode
```bash
# Basic mode (legacy)
python cli.py

# Enhanced mode with validation
python cli.py --enhanced

# Direct query with enhanced features
python cli.py --enhanced --query "software development lifecycle methodologies"
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. **Query Analysis**
The AI analyzes your research question to understand:
- Research intent and domain
- Key concepts and terminology
- Temporal focus (recent vs. foundational)
- Expected paper types and sources

### 2. **Multi-Source Search**
Executes comprehensive search across multiple academic databases:
- Generates dynamic search strategies
- Searches Semantic Scholar, ArXiv, and optionally Google Scholar
- Ranks sources by quality metrics (citations, venue, recency)
- Removes duplicates and filters for relevance

### 3. **Iterative Refinement**
Improves search results through multiple iterations:
- Identifies gaps in current findings
- Generates follow-up search strategies
- Adapts search terms based on previous results
- Continues until comprehensive coverage achieved

### 4. **Relevance Assessment**
AI evaluates each source for relevance:
- Uses GPT-4o mini for intelligent relevance scoring
- Considers abstract content and metadata
- Provides explanation for relevance decisions
- Classifies as highly relevant, maybe relevant, or not relevant

### 5. **Structured Synthesis**
Creates professional research analysis:
- Executive summary with key findings
- Detailed analysis with evidence quality assessment
- Categorized findings and comparative analysis
- Practical applications and limitations
- Research gaps and future directions
